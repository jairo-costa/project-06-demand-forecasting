    "**1. What do I believe the problem is asking?**  \n",
    "The problem requires forecasting the *future daily delivery demand* based on historical data.  \n",
    "The goal is to predict the next value(s) of the time series in order to support operational planning.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. What type of data do I expect?**  \n",
    "A time-indexed dataset containing:  \n",
    "- a `date` column (daily frequency)  \n",
    "- a `demand` column (integer or float)  \n",
    "The date carries temporal structure such as weekday, month, seasonality, and trend.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Is this a supervised or unsupervised problem? Why?**  \n",
    "This is a **supervised learning problem**, because past observations include the true target values.  \n",
    "The model learns a mapping from historical values to future values.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Why is forecasting appropriate here?**  \n",
    "Because the target depends on temporal patterns (trend, seasonality, autocorrelation).  \n",
    "Forecasting models are designed to learn these patterns and project future demand values.\n",
    "\n",
    "**5. What approaches could be tested?**  \n",
    "- Statistical baselines: Naïve, Moving Average, Drift  \n",
    "- ARIMA/SARIMA (optional for trend/seasonality)  \n",
    "- Machine Learning with engineered temporal features  \n",
    "- Prophet or similar additive models  \n"
